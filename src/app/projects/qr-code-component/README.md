## My process
- I first checked to see whether the layout differed between mobile and desktop, but they did not.
- I next considered what items I required and discovered that I required a box with an image, a header, and a paragraph.
- Then I noticed that there was space on the box, between the image and the text, and between the header and the paragraph.
- I put the header and paragraph in a box, so there should be a `gap` in between the image and the text, as well as a `gap` in between the header and the paragraph.
- Then I noticed that the text did not line up perfectly with the reference image, so I added `letter-spacing`, but the text was still not perfectly aligned but was closer enough to the original.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework

### What I learned

I have improved my [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) skills, and I learned that I can preview my Markdown documents in Visual Studio Code, eliminating the need to upload them to GitHub to see their formatting.

### Continued development

I do not know if there is anything i particular i want to get better at, i thought this challenge was pretty easy

### Useful resources

- When I didn't know the syntax for the CSS property I needed to use, I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) documentation
